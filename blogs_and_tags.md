## Page explores ways to include posts on a page

We can get access to the site's posts and other collections by using "site.collections". The object gives you access to document labels - titles for posts.

Tag page thoughts: I could build all the tags into the hidden divs. Using the query string, and JavaScript, I could select one of the hidden divs and show the documents under the tag.
